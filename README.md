# Condor
A React CMS For BUILD UMass

Hi everyone! I'm not sure if I can make it to today's BUILD Meeting. If I don't show up please at least set up everything from the Github. Go to the wiki tab to read up more directions.

Also, we will be using Trello to update our tasks and what we really need to get done for this project.

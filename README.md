A React CMS For BUILD UMass

Hi everyone! I'm not sure if I can make it to today's BUILD Meeting due to upcoming exams. If I don't show up please at least set up everything from the Github. Go to the wiki tab to read up more directions. To set up everything press on the `Getting Started (Developers)` tab.

Then when you are set up, start going over what you've researched this week and have someone document that all down. This week, we are building up the user stories, vision statement, looking at our tech stack, and starting the development of the project. 

We will be using Trello to update our tasks and what we really need to get done for this project.
